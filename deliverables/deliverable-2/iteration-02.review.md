## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 6, 2020
 * Where: Lance Oribello’s apartment

## Process - Reflection

We will analyze the success/lack of success of our decisions using the “5 Whys” assessment framework. With this framework, we can directly determine the root causes of our success/lack thereof for each decision.

#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well


1. Using Slack as our main method of communication

We decided to create a Slack channel to communicate with ourselves as well as our partner. 

Within Slack, we have multiple text channels, including a general communication channel (mainly used for scheduling our weekly partner meetings and asking questions to our partners), a private team channel (for team discussion regarding the project that our partner does not need to see), and frontend and backend channels (where discussion pertaining to each respective aspect of the project is held).

We think our decision to use Slack has been very successful.
*  *Why?* 
    - Internal communication between team members as well as communication with our partners has been very responsive.
* *Why?*
    - Slack is convenient for everyone to use and is easily-accessible.
*  *Why?* 
    - Slack notifies us of new messages across all of our devices in real-time, allowing for people to immediately answer questions, acknowledge any updates on development, and schedule times to meet as a team.
    - As such, we are always on the same page on how the project is going, and any ambiguities can be addressed very quickly.

2. Weekly scheduled in-person meetings with the partner

We decided to schedule (through Slack) an in-person meeting with our partners every week, during which we can update them on our progress, ask questions on anything we are unsure of, and discuss any roadblocks we have encountered.

We think our decision to have weekly in-person meetings has been very successful.
*  *Why?* 
    - Scheduled weekly meetings allow for more consistent progress on the project.
*  *Why?* 
    - The team is motivated to work on the project more regularly.
*  *Why?* 
    - There is an expectation for new features to be presented to our partners at each meeting.
*  *Why?* 
    - We want our partners to be satisfied with our rate of progress, and we also want the chance to regularly receive direct feedback on features as we implement them.
    - As such, we can confidently design our application with our partner regularly being in the loop on our progress.
